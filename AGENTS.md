# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `front/src/` holds React + TypeScript code (`main.tsx`, `App.tsx`, and `src/assets/` for shared media); group new features by directory and co-locate component styles with their component.
- `front/public/` serves static files that bypass the bundler—favicon, manifest, and any externally hosted assets.
- `front/dist/` is generated by Vite builds; never edit or commit artifacts there.
- Frontend configs live under `front/` (`vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig*.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`); update alongside structural changes.
- `server/app/` contains the FastAPI code; keep routers, schemas, and DB helpers modular.
- `docker/` houses compose files and nginx config used for containerised deployments.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Run all npm scripts from `front/`.
- `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server with hot module replacement; use it for day-to-day development.
- `npm run build` runs `tsc -b` to enforce type safety before producing production bundles in `front/dist/`.
- `npm run preview` serves the latest build to mimic production routing.
- `npm run lint` executes ESLint with the React and hooks plugins; ensure a clean run before submitting work.
- Backend: from `server/`, use `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` for development and `pytest` once tests are added.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use 2-space indentation, TypeScript types for component props, and prefer functional components with hooks.
- Name components and files in `PascalCase` (`MyWidget.tsx`), hooks in `camelCase` (`useWidget.ts`), and Tailwind utility variants in lower-case strings.
- Leverage Tailwind classes for layout; extract reusable patterns into small helper components instead of ad-hoc duplication.
- Run `npm run lint` after refactors and when touching configuration to keep eslint autofixes aligned.

## Testing Guidelines
- Frontend testing stack is not yet configured; introduce `vitest` + `@testing-library/react` under `front/src/__tests__/ComponentName.test.tsx` when adding coverage.
- Keep fixtures lightweight and prefer React Testing Library queries over DOM traversal.
- Backend tests should live under `server/tests/` (create when needed) using `pytest` + `httpx.AsyncClient` or similar.
- Ensure new features include at least smoke coverage and avoid merging with failing or skipped cases.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- The repository lacks an established history; follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) so automation can evolve later.
- Scope commits narrowly, include contextual details in the body, and reference relevant issues.
- Pull requests should describe the change, list validation steps (`npm run lint`, `npm run build`), and add screenshots or screen recordings for UI updates.
- Request review when the branch is rebased on the latest mainline and all required checks pass locally.
