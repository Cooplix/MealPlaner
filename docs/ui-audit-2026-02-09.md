# UI Audit and Spec Snapshot

Date: 2026-02-09

## Scope Reviewed
- Dishes (list, search, preview, modal)
- Inventory (products, selectors)
- Shopping, Purchases, Spending, Dish Costs (lists, filters, sorting)
- Ingredients (unit selection)

## Findings (Current Pain Points)
- Autocomplete hints were inconsistent and hard to scan (native datalist UX).
- Dish cards expanded unpredictably with long recipes.
- Dish detail modal lacked scroll handling.
- Dish search only matched dish names, not ingredients.
- Lists and selectors were unsorted or inconsistently ordered.

## Implemented Fixes (Already in Code)
- Custom `AutocompleteInput` with keyboard navigation and styled list.
- Dish cards now have uniform height; long notes truncated with "Show more".
- Dish details modal has constrained height with scroll.
- Dish search includes ingredient names and translations.
- Alphabetical sorting for selector lists and multiple sort modes for major lists.

## Standards to Codify
- All selectors and option lists default to alphabetical ordering by label.
- Data-heavy lists provide a sort control with page-appropriate modes (name, recency, amount, etc.).
- Modals must cap height and allow internal scrolling.
- Recipe previews must not expand card height; full content is accessed via modal.
- Autocomplete components must support keyboard selection and visible focus state.

## Next Step
- Proceed with `docs/ui-improvement-plan-2026-02-08.md` Step 2:
  - introduce base UI components (StatusBadge, InlineAlert, SectionHeader, EmptyState),
  - define reusable tokens for status colors and spacing,
  - replace ad-hoc markup where practical.
